## Quick Start

### Requirements

- `npm` or Yarn
- Node.js
- Next.js 9.5+

### Installation

```sh
npm install next-safe

# OR

yarn add next-safe
```

### Usage

`next-safe` exports a single function that generates all of your headers. In your `next.config.js` file, you can pass these directly into the `headers` key for any route you want to set the headers on.

```js
const nextSafe = require("next-safe");

const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";

module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        headers: nextSafe({ isDev })
      }
    ];
  }
};
```

By default, this sets all of the headers you need and provides substantial protections for your Next.js application. However, the defaults are also _super strict_. See the [Configuration](./configuration.md) section for details on how to make `next-safe` a bit more flexible.
